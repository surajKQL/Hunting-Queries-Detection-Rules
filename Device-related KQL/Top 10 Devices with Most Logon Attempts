This query helps monitor successful logon attempts to devices within an organization over the last 24 hours. 
It identifies devices with the highest number of logon attempts, grouped by account, timestamp, and remote IP. 
This can be used to detect potential brute-force attacks, unusual logon activity, or compliance violations. 
By analyzing the frequency and origin of logins, security teams can quickly identify suspicious behavior, investigate potential threats, and ensure that access policies are being followed.

// Start by accessing the DeviceLogonEvents table, which contains logon-related events.
DeviceLogonEvents
// Filter the events to only include those that occurred in the last 24 hours.
| where Timestamp > ago(1d) // Change as per requirement
// Further filter the data to only include successful logon events.
| where ActionType == "LogonSuccess" 
// Summarize the data by DeviceName, AccountName, Timestamp, and RemoteIP.
// For each combination of these fields, count how many logon attempts occurred.
| summarize LogonAttempts = count() by DeviceName, AccountName, Timestamp, RemoteIP
// Sort the summarized data in descending order based on LogonAttempts, 
// and select the top 10 devices/accounts with the highest number of logon attempts.
| top 10 by LogonAttempts desc
// Project only the relevant columns (DeviceName, AccountName, Timestamp, RemoteIP) to be displayed in the output.
| project DeviceName, AccountName, Timestamp, RemoteIP
